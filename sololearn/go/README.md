# Go Algorithms

A focused folder for **learning algorithms through Go**.

The purpose is not only to solve problems, but to:

* Write **idiomatic Go**
* Understand Go-specific behavior (slices, maps, pointers)
* Practice clear error handling and control flow

### Style guidelines

* Prefer readability over micro-optimizations
* Use inline comments to explain decisions
* Keep files independent when possible

All examples are intended to be run locally:

```bash
go run file.go
```
