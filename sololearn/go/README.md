# Go Algorithms

A curated folder of **algorithmic and advanced programming examples written in Go**.

This folder serves as:

* A learning space for Go idioms and internals
* A reference for common and uncommon algorithmic patterns
* A playground for experimenting with performance, correctness, and clarity

### Design principles

* Idiomatic Go over generic solutions
* Explicit code over hidden magic
* Simple examples before optimized ones

### Usage

Most files are runnable directly:

```bash
go run file.go
```

Some algorithms include tests:

```bash
go test
```

This folder evolves gradually as new concepts and refinements are added.
